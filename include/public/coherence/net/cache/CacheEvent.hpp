/**
* An extension of the MapEvent which allows to differentiate between client
* driven (natural) events and cache internal (synthetic) events.
*
* Consider a client code calling a remove() method for a cache. Quite
* naturally it causes a corresponding entry_deleted event. However, the same
* event could be as well caused by the client code calling put() forcing an
* entry eviction.  Alternatively, the put() method called by client code
* naturally causes either entry_inserted or entry_updated event. However, the
* same event could be as well caused by a client call to a get() method that
* in turn forces an entry insertion by a cache loader.
